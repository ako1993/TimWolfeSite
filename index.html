        <p>Tim Wolfe has jokes for days! Or at least a little over an hour. Winner of numerous comedy competitions (and the forever champion of the now-defunct Youngstown Comedy Festival) Tim’s jokes about poorly making sandwiches are surpassed only by his jokes about poorly working the register at PetSmart. 

          Tim has opened for Tony Hinchcliffe, almost opened for Bob Saget, and filled in on a show Bobcat Goldthwaite didn’t wanna do. 
          
          Tim is currently a headlining performer on the Brewery Comedy Tour and a staple at comedy clubs within a 50 mile radius of his mom’s house.
